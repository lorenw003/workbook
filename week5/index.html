The studio asks students to ‘reread’ critical texts on art and language through the use of computer code to explore how reading and graphic design are transforming in the digital age. Students are taught to expand their design practice by combining code and typography. </p>

                            <p>This website is a showcase of student work from this course in 2024. I really like the way the tile “codewords” appears static with electricity and changes based on distance from the mouse. Likewise the student work collated on this page is each feature unique and interesting storytelling. Oscillate requires user to put on their webcam and then “oscillate” their body to move the reflected video and reveal hidden text.</p>

                            <p> <a href="https://headbanger.ai/" target="_blank"><b>HEAD BANGER</b></a> is an experimental game by Hello Monday, featuring music from Dracaris’s album “Nowhere”. The game’s aesthetic is inspired by the album specifically the themes of metal rock, hallucination and schizophrenia. Within the game the player is shown as panel featuring their web camera footage on one side of board with blocks in the centre. A skull on the opposite side releases a fireball when the users opens their mouth. The player must then prevent the ball from going off the screen and make it hit the block by moving their head to move the panel and bounce the ball off. They can also head bang to make the ball bounce. </p>

                            <p>This experience was made using three.js and Javscript. The user consistently maintains enough agency to play the game. However the motions required itself are not very precise and would have limited use elsewhere. However the user does not maintain agency of their image as it not stated whether it is stored, just asked for permission.</p>

Atshushi would approach Web camera owners for images and use original rendering software, SIC (Synergistic Image Creator) to create Webcam Art. Afterwards she would send the images to web cam owners for feedback and send them a poster-sized copy if requested. </p>

                            <p>Synergistic Image Creator is series of GIMP source plug-in modules. GIMP is is an open-source photo retouch software working on Linux and Windows. The images created from SIC include a history of the image process. So anyone can access the history to modify it and apply it to their own images. Web cam owners could find and use effects applied to their images on other images.</p>

                    <p>Slave to the Algorithm is a studio taught at RMIT by Karen ann Donnachie and Andy Simionato. It focuses on emerging design practices in generative design, parametric typography, and data-visualisation. The  subsequent works showcase different forms of generative art and data visualisation from different stimuli and parametric fonts.</p>

                        Computer vision describes how computers can see and interpret images and videos, similar to humans. This includes the categorisation of images and facial identification. Facial recognition can be achieved with 15 basic points on person’s face. This information is stored in passports and government databases and used to identify people in CCTV and other footage.

                        For this activity we were asked to consider different ways users can interact with web based script. Ways we thought included manual text input, keystrokes, mouse and touchpad gestures, clicks including double clicks, hovering, voice input, audio files, tapping physical tech, clicking hardware buttons (ie. volume button on Iphone), video input, live video.

                        We were also asked to consider alternative that currently don’t exist. There is potential to incorporate smell, which detects certain smell similar to how a smoke detector detects smoke.

                        This week, I adapted the metaphor of my workbook to better suit the interactive of the site. I decided the change the theme from a physical archive (ie. records) to a digital file where users need to game access. For this I change the colour palette, type and layout for the individual workbook pages.

                        <br>This included adding functional features such as dropdown content and creating a dynamic layout.
