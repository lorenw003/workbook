                <p> <a href="https://spellverse.taprootwizards.com/"><i>Spellverse</i></a> is an interactive site produced by Taproot Wizards in 2023, an online community committed to making “Bitcoin magical again”. The site involves users exploring the spell verse to find and complete “quests and missions”, which appear to be sourced from social media (twitter or X). There is also a related discord server for players to interact. </p>

                <p> <a href="https://www.moviepalaceonline.com/"><i>Movie Palace Online</i></a> is an ARG (Alternative Reality Game) that simulates interacting with an older PC for players to “unravel a mystery”. The game involves a series of puzzles, clues, directions and hints to guides players through an interactive story.  Players learn how to start the game by opening a readme file which explains the concept and next steps.  </p>

It explains the game to players and then allows players to play the game. Although the site is Japanese, the game is made to be very visual so players can play without reading the text.</p>

            <a href="https://theuselessweb.com"><h3>The Useless Site</h3></a>
            <p>The site took me to Calligraphy Creator, a page where you can paint or make calligraphy with a brush that produces a stream of words. The size of the word is variable to the pressure of the click/drag of the “pen”. You interact by dragging the cursor across the screen to use the brush and create lines of words. Users can also click buttons on the centre bottom of the page to change the colour of the text and content of the text coming from the brush. It is preset to a specific paragraph. Users can also download and delete their work from the screen using buttons on the right side with related icons. There is also an button with a wave icon which leads to page explaining the site. The pointer is a target.</p>

            <h3>Paper Prototyping</h3>
            <p>Paper prototypes are low fidelity concepts for a website or design. They enable us to test  different concepts - layout, interaction - quickly, easily and at a low cost. They help plan out how a site will actually work and look, like a blueprint for a house. They can also increase creativity. Without the limitations of web, paper and pen foster experimentation and new ideas.</p>

                <p>Crazy Eights is an exercise of drawing or creating 8 concepts within one minute. The process helps initiate ideation and divergent design processes. This exercise helped get all my ideas out to visually see and compare them including the “bad ones” . It helped me realise what was maybe not so bad and which were less feasible but also forced my not neglect I had assumed were “bad”.</p>

                <h3>Make it Bling</h3>
                <p>I was inspired by the metaphor of the weeks being stacked like records or pages, each week represented by an image similar to record cover. I composed a modular paper prototype of the concept. After the studio I also composed further sketches of different user flows and pages within this concept.</p>

            <p>Afterwards I explored using these layout concepts to test designs similar to my paper prototype and sketches. Specifically using flex boxes for individual weeks and further exploring scroll and overflow.  </p>
