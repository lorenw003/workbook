It is a swarm of 60 small robots inspired by the synchronous behaviour of insects like fireflies. Each robot has a solenoid (taps floor), a vibrating motor (rings bell) and red and green lasers. When a robot detects a colour (red or green), it will become the same colour and emit the corresponding sound. Green and the sound of blow are linked and red and sound of the bell are linked. This creates an audiovisual experience of the transition between states. Dyad means two or a pair.</p>

Each painting performance is 9 minutes in length and entirely improvised to showcase a process of human & robotic co-creation. The performance reimagines the tradition of landscape painting as collaboration between artist, swarm and city. Omnia per Omnia is a continuation of a long-term project by Sougwen exploring human & robotic collaboration. This project saw the “evolution of robotic form from singular to collective”.</p>

The pixel tiles change their colour in response to touch and can also be altered by remote control. When grouped, the pixel tiles create patterns and animations which could serve as tool for customising physical spaces. The installation makes pixels physical to draw focus to their materiality and the possibility of similar future design forms.</p>

                        Nonhuman drawing machines are an example of physical computing that attempts to imitate human behaviour. Sketching and drawing is not usually done with full certainty or strokes. There is human hesitation in drawing which it makes it difficult to imitate. Direct algorithms will be too precise too perfect to be human, so more experimental approaches must be considered. How do show organic creativity through machines?

                        This week, we learned how to connect p5 and Arduino. This opens up the opportunity tp use each other as input and explore a new dimension of the both. Which could potentially be applied to my final project.
