                            <p> <a href="https://sxywu.github.io/filmflowers/" target="_blank"><b>FILM FLOWERS</b></a> by Shirley Wu is a website that visualises data on the top summer blockbusters for each year as flowers. The site features a legend explaining how the age rating, genre, imdb votes and ratings are visualised for each film. This is followed by visualisations for five films each year from 2016 to 19990 is descending order. The legend uses size, pattern, shape, colour and the overlaying of different patterns to represent data about the films. The site was built using javascript.</p>

                            <p>This visualisation is unique way of perceiving data and not an approach I would usually use for data visualisation. However I think it will visualisation me to consider more inventive and engaging ways of presenting data in the future.</p>

It addresses the lack of similar accessible but also professional typefaces. Although Comic Sans is considered one of the most accessible fonts, it is not often “the look you’d want for [more professional settings”. Inclusive Sans is an exploration in typographic accessibility focused on creating something functional but also adaptable to different settings. It is intended to make accessibility the default rather than an afterthought, which is common in the industry. The font is open and currently available on google fonts. </p>

                        It is easy perceive data as intangible, in the cloud. However data must have physical form to be stored and used. Data exists in data ranches where data is stored in servers, physical data cables between continents and data networks including WANs, LANs and MANs. This data has also become a commodity used to identify and target consumers but also to generate income in the case of click farms. Click farms fabricate likes, follows and views to profit off engagement.

                        Data can also form narratives or stories in which data is used as medium, muse and/or message to narrate social, personal or global stories

                            For this activity we were asked to empty the contents of our bag and then sort them into groups. I sorted my items by what was supposed to be in my bag, what was only supposed to be there today and what was never supposed to be there (from right to left). This also be considered as sort by what was I knew was in there and what I did not.

                            For the second part of the activity we combined our things with three other people and sorted them by different criteria. We decided to sort ours in order of how much you could sell it for if you stole it.

                        In this class we learned how to add sound including playing prerecorded files and capturing live microphone audio. We also learned how to trigger patterns and effects based on the properties of these sounds (ie. amplitude).
