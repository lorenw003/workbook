                            <i>Mosaic Virus (2018)</i> and <i>Mosaic Virus (2019)</i> by Anna Ridler are a series of works that explore  capitalism, value, and collapse from different points in history. The first is a single screen moving image piece which displays a grid of tulips continually in bloom. The second is a three screen video installation, each showing an individual tulip. In both, the appearance of the tulips is controlled by the price of bitcoin, changing over time to show how the market fluctuates.

                        <p> <i>Myraid (Tulips)</i> is an installation of thousands of hand-labeled photographs of tulips, which later composed the dataset for Mosaic Virus 2018 and Mosaic Virus 2019. Each photograph is labeled with the colour, state (blooming) and stripes of the flower. The pieces draws attention to the skill, labour and time that goes into constructing a data set and reintroduces a visible human elements to machine learning usually hidden within algorithms.</p>

                        <p> <i>Glitch textiles</i> is conceptual textile designlabel founded by Phillip David Stearns in 2011. The labelwas inspired by his work in a Year of Glitch, “a year-long glitch-a-day project” (GlitchTextiles, 2022). In which he translated digital glitches into woven designs. His designs use various methods including visualising raw binary data, customising algorithms and in one piece exposing instant film to high volt-age electricity to translate into woven designs. </p>

                        <p> <i>Maria Szakats</i> is a Austrian fashion designer and artist, who works primarily with textiles. Her work combines embroidery and tapestry weaving with photography to create “ multifaceted, magical, and slightly eerie art pieces”(Donoghue, n.d.). She uses mohair wool to weave and embroider AI generated images at a small scale and then brushes the surface to create a blurred appearance. </p>
