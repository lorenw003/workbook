It was one of first mobile games to focus on the visuals and scenery of gameplay. It features meticulously crafted illustrated scenery that induces a mediative and calming gameplay.</p>

                            <p>The visuals were designed by Lili Ibrahim. She was inspired by notions of conflict and contrast: 3D objects and 2D illustration, nature and city, slight ugliness and juxtaposition. She applied methods inspired by matisse’s cut out placing physical cut outs of illustration on top of printed screen shots. This created a combination of 3D and 2D animation.</p>

                            <p>This multimedia approach and the astoundingly peaceful resulting design, despite internal conflict is very impressive. Her approach is something specifically I would be interested in approaching in my own work.</p>

                    <p>Angelo Pleasses is a performance and digital artist. His work combines digital and spiritual elements to challenge binaries (ie. online and offline) and examine what spirituality resonates with “the networked system of contemporary life”. </p>
                    <p>WORK: rituals, videos, artist residencies, artist’s books, interactive websites, quilted sculptures, neon installations, educational projects</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Menu animation, the menu links fly in from the right and be caught in the write at intervals. This prevents users from immediately interacting with the page and force them look at the main page before interacting.</li>
                        <li>Cursor, the cursor uses a custom cursor image which leaves a trail when used in the menu bar. This creates a fun visual effect which can be created p5.js or javascript within HTML.</li>
                        <li>Background animation, the background image features a parallax effect similar to a kaleidoscope triggered by the mouse movements. </li>
                        <li> Dropdowns are used within the sidebar menu to hide and reveal content in the menu. This reduces the amount of content and makes it easier to consume.</li>
